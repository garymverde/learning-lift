<h2>LiftTravel</h2>
<p>I've created this project as a space for following along with the creation of the travel auction application from the book Lift In Action.  

This is the Lift Travel application.  I'm not forking the author's git repo because I want to assemble this application as I follow along in the book.  Some files are copied from his work where it make sense.  This isn't a css or html learning exercise, so some of that code is copied.  Obviously the images are copied too.
