# learning-lift

I've been working to learn the Lift framework.  It's 2021.  Lift hasn't been actively maintained for many years.  The books written about Lift are nearly as old as my 10 year old son.  Lift is the foundation for the application that's being enhanced and maintained by the non-profit that I'm work with. 

I've been working through the example problems that are included in the book Exploring Lift.  It has not been easy, pleasant, or fun, unfortunately.  It took me nearly 3 days to get HelloWorld to run.  I started from scratch 3 times.  As I embarked on the 2nd example problem, I realized that there were still issues with my third attempt at HelloWorld.

This repository is intended to capture the work that I've done to get these example problems working.  If other people are in a situation where they too must learn how Lift works, perhaps this I can help make this task a little easier.
